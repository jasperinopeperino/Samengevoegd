    <!-- First Question -->
    <div class="title-container">
        <h2 class="interview-question">How does it feel to be here, walking among us?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="interview-answer">
        “I’m always here.”
    </p>

    <!-- Second Question -->
    <div class="title-container">
        <h2 class="interview-question">Feeling more enlightened after Tuesday night’s trial?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="interview-answer">
        “Of course, I’m better. I’m at peace with what I saw in my disciples after the match. I’m happy that the faithful were sad, frustrated—it’s all part of the divine plan. We share the same spirit. There’s no time to dwell in the darkness. I’m happy to see my players rise again, just as I rise, because we all know that the only way is forward, together.”
    </p>

    <!-- Third Question -->
    <div class="title-container">
        <h2 class="interview-question">Has there been a spiritual awakening on the training pitch since then?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="interview-answer">
        “We train very well, always. There’s no need for a special reaction to train better; it’s just in the air with us. The devotion, the passion, the commitment—they’ve been with us since day one. It’s a bond that makes us stronger with each step.”
    </p>

      <!-- Fourth Question -->
      <div class="title-container">
        <h2 class="interview-question">How sacred is the upcoming Brighton match?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="interview-answer">
        “Every match is important—it’s all part of the holy journey. Some fans might think some games hold more weight than others, but as a servant to the cause, I see every match as essential. Every challenge brings us closer to our destiny.”
    </p>

    <!-- Fifth Question -->
    <div class="title-container">
        <h2 class="interview-question">Some followers have expressed disappointment in your disciples’ performance. How do you respond?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="interview-answer">
        “I tell my followers—they are entitled to their opinions, to their reactions. But there’s something greater at work here, something we call ‘football heritage.’ It’s the legacy we inherit, and it’s much more than just the numbers. It’s the journey, the path we walk together. When I arrived, I knew we had to rebuild. This is what I call football heritage—the lessons of the past.”
    </p>

    <!-- Sixth Question -->
    <div class="title-container">
        <h2 class="interview-question">You speak of ‘football heritage’ often. What does it mean for your flock?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="interview-answer">
     <p>“Football heritage isn’t just about the past—it’s about understanding the steps we must take to grow. When I arrived at Manchester United, I knew we were starting from a place where the foundation had been weakened. At Real Madrid, it was the same. The players hadn’t tasted the glory of the Champions League quarter-finals, but they were ready to rise. That’s what heritage does—it shapes us, pushes us, and tells us where we must go.” </p> <br/> <p>“The truth is in the numbers, in the story of the journey. The stats speak for themselves. Manchester City’s rise, for example, is not just by chance; it’s the fruit of past labor. It’s the investments of those who came before us. It’s all part of the grand design.”</p>
    <p>“There is a code, one that I live by: ‘In every wall, there is a door.’ We don’t hide from challenges, we face them head-on with strength. I don’t fear responsibility—I wear it proudly. From the moment I started, I knew that it wasn’t about waiting for glory—it’s about walking the path, step by step. And I have walked it, with work, with talent, and with a mentality that cannot be broken.”
</p> 
<br/>

<p>So, in seven years with four different managers, once not qualify for Europe, twice out in the group phase and the best was the quarter-final. This is football heritage.</p>

<p>“If you want to go to the Premier League, the last victory was 12-13 and in the four consecutive seasons United finish fourth fifth, sixth and seventh. So in the last four years the best was fourth. This is football heritage. It means that when you start the process you are here, you are there or you are there, is heritage.
And if the fans that I will always respect – always respect – if the fans and many of them are the ones you speak with, many of them are the ones I speak with, and I am very lucky. The ones who speak with you are very disappointed and the ones I speak with know what is football heritage, what is a process and when I arrive.
</p>
<br/>

<p> I arrived in Real Madrid, do you know how many players had played in the quarter final of the Champions League? Xabi Alonso with Liverpool, Iker Casillas with Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo with Manchester United. All the others not even a quarter-final. That’s football heritage.”
</p>

     <!-- Seventh Question -->
 <div class="title-container">
    <h2 class="interview-question">Finally, you talk about happiness. In a world that often questions your divine path, how do you find joy?</h2>
</div>

<p class="interview-answer">
    “Happiness isn’t in the titles or trophies—it’s in the journey. It’s in watching my disciples rise, in seeing them grow. I learned this from my religious formation: rejoice in others’ happiness. And so, when my players rise from the ashes, stronger and more united, that is my happiness. It’s all about the process—the victories will follow.”
